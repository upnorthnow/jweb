<p>mainly recorded from mid-sixties and seventies,aswell as more recent recordings. mostly produced in the major recording centres of detroit, philadelphia, chicago, and new york.  the northern soul scene revolved most especially around the original all-nighters, and smaller local clubs. it has always been about playing the totally unknown recordings from small independent labels with limited production runs, although bigger labels contributed a significant amount ofsounds,although even these would be difficult to obtain in this country outside of the context of specialist suppliers and sources.
